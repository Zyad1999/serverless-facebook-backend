Readme Start

For my Capstone project i decided to go with the serverless option and make an API for a facebook clone application this API allow authenticated user to: 
	1-Post new posts and make it public or private.
	2-Add a photo to a post.
	3-Edit text of a post or the privacy of a post.
	4-Delete a post.
	5-Get all public posts of other users.
	6-Get all his posts public and private.
	7-Get other user's public posts.

My api has 8 functions and they are:

	1-Authentication function that authenticates users using auth0.

	2-GetPosts (GET /posts) which allows an authenticated user to see all public posts on the application.

	3-GetPost (GET /posts/postId) which allows an authenticated user to get a post that belong to him with postId.

	4-GetUserPosts (GET /users/userId) which allows an authenticated user to either all of his posts if the request is to 
	his userId or other user's public posts if the request is to another user`s userId.

	5-CreatPost (POST /posts) which allows an authenticated user to create a new post with privacy option.

	6-UpdatePost (PATCH /posts/postId) which allows an authenticated user to update the text or privacy of a post that he have.

	7-DeletePost (DELETE /posts/postId) which allows an authenticated user to  delete a post that he have.

	8-GenerateUploadUrl (POST posts/postId/attachment) which adds an attachment url to a post and returns upload url from S3 to upload the image on.

Notes:

	The API also implements request validation through serverless-req-validator-plugin and schemas for create post and update post are used.

	To be able to use query to get all public posts from the table I used a global secondary index with privacy as its partition key and postId as its sort key to make each item unique.

	To be able to use query to get a user's public or private data i used another global secondary index with custom field "userIdPrivacy" as the partition key
	so that i can query with two unquniqe parameters from the table and used postId as sort key to make each item unique.

	For the main table i used userId and todoId to be able to do delete,patchand get on a single item with parameters available in the request.

	Note that to make the endpoint (GET /users/userId) i could not store and use the userId stored in auth0 token because it had special characters that made
	the request to this endpoint returns a bad request so I made the function that gets the userId from the token return only the unique user number from the id to store it and use it.
	
Testing:
	To test the API i included a postman collection with 2 tokens for 2 users to be able to test the functionality of privacy in each user i made requests to 
	create new posts, delete a post, get a single post of that user, get all public posts, get all of his posts, get the other included user`s public posts
	update one of his posts and add attachment to one of his posts which are all the 8 possible tests.
